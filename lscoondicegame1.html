        <p>
          This game allows two users to play against each other. The goal of the
          game is to be the first player to acquire thirty points. Both players
          start with zero points and take turns. When it is Player 1's turn,
          they can throw the pair of dice as many times as they want, adding the
          total of each throw to their score. Player 1 can choose to stop
          throwing at any point, if they stop throwing then their current score
          is added to their overall score. If Player 1 does not stop and throws
          one of the dice with a six, then Player 1's turn ends and Player 1
          gets 0 added to their overall score. If Player 1 is still throwing and
          they throw double sixes, then Player 1's overall total score goes back
          to 0. (i.e., not only does Player 1 lose the scores from this round
          but they lose all the points they have accumulated in previous
          rounds). You may choose to have the double sixes rule removed and let
          a double six be the same as a single six by checking the box below.
