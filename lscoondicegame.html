        <p>
          This game allows two users to play against each other. The goal of the
          game is to be the first person to acquire thirty points. Both players
          start with zero points and take turns. When it is Player 1's turn,
          they can throw the pair of dice as many times as they want adding the
          total of each throw to their score. Player 1 can choose to stop
          throwing at any point, if they stop throwing then their score is added
          to their overall total. If Player 1 does not stop and throws one of
          the dice with a six, then Player 1's turn ends and Player 1 gets 0
          added to their score. If Player 1 is still throwing and they throw
          double sixes, then Player 1's overall total score goes back to 0.
          (i.e., not only does Player 1 lose the scores from this round but they
          lose all the points they have accumulated in previous rounds). You may
          choose to have the double sixes rule striken and let a double six be
          the same as a single six.
